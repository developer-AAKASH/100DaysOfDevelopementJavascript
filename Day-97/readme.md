API-gateway: 

Yesterday, I start with AWS-lamda, which is serverless functionalities for your web-pages, but lamdas are individually not meaningful. so thats why..

Today, I learn about API-Gateway, which is one more essential and very powerful tool of serverless, using which, you can backbon your hosted websites in very customized manner.

API-gateway allows you to take different types of requests and lamdas support them with functionalities.

API-gateway is very good and powerful component of AWS-serverless.
