--> Today, I learn about bucket policy and how you can define policy or rules for your whole bucket.

-> Here, bucket means a folder or place where your web pages are stored for hosting and rules are in the context of files accessing, which of the file or resource allow accessing publically and which not !!

-> We can't allow everyone to access our resources and to restrict the access, we can define policy for all the files and resources.

-> One of the ways could be that we can manually do it for all the files but that will be a bad solution.

-> I also start exploring "AWS-lambda".
