-------------AWS lamdas:
	AWS-lamdas are the functionality, in which you can configure basics functionality for responding to your web-page without configuring any servers, basically serverless.
	
	Now question is...
	1). What is serverless !?
		Serverless means you don't configure anything or any server for hosting your web-pages, you dont configure OS, set-up OS, and basically you dont do any thing, you use utilities which provide you server's functionality to host your web-pages.
		-> Internally all this configuration will be done by host in our case, AWS.
		-> So this way, many heavy tasks like how to maintain traffic, servers, and such a thing will be handled by AWS in place of us.
		-> When we want very good level of customization for hosting giangatic web-apps, at that time, you supposed to configure your servers and all the thing.
		
So, Lamdas are the functionality which helps us to take little bit power in hour hand for providing response and some other functionality for our web-pages.
