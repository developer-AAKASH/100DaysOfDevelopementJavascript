So on Day-76, we configured everything, now its time to write code so from today onward, I just provide "src" folder in which, my all code file and folder structure will be there rest everything will be same.

Any change will be added on readme file for that respected day.

Today, In android/app/build.gradle, I make one more change to avoid errors !!

Inside default config,

Add, "multiDexEnabled true" this line after versioName line.
