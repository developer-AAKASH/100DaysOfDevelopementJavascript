Today, I learn about handleing POST request through API-gateway and lamda and why specially POST request, because handleing of it is bit different then others.

And while dealing with POST request, I also learn about CORS( Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ) which is a kind of permission-sharing or allowing for access of the resources on the cloud or server.

I also learn about SES which is (Simple Email Service) offered by AWS. It is very simple and  awesome service.

This looks very simple but such a functionalities help us to implement softwre automation for notification sending.
