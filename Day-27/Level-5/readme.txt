User authentication involves several things like session management, cookie management and
user data and privacy management.

Manage all the things single handedly is bit hactic so lets used in built packages.

Today I used "passport", "passport-local-mongoose", "express-session".

This package handles all the things( session management, cookie management and privacy)
very well !!
