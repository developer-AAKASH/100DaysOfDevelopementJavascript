Today I learn about how docker cache memory works in which I understand how and when docker creates a temporary container and when it uses the cache memory to re-use the old temporary containers to optimize the performance.

Caching concept of docker is very important in order to understand the optimized and impressive performance of the docker.

For learning purpose, I also start one mini-node project in order to containerize it for production and save my project from that phrase "it works on my system".

Here, there is no compulsion of "node-project" you can take any language or framework in order to make the project, the sole purpose is to make any project containerize.
