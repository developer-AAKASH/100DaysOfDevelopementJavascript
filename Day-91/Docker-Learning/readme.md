Today I continue with docker learning.

I learn about how we can create our own custome images, what are the steps to create our own custome image.

I learn some command which are kind of explicit docker commands ( kind of docker's own language ), which helps you to build your own docker image.

It is like scripting language which is build for creating docker image.
