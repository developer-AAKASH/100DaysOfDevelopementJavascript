Today, I set-up other view and components related to that which you can see in the src folder and I make one change in index.js file of the root directiory so I also added index.js too.

Today, I completed with redux part, all the redux setup like, actions, reducers and finally combine them to acces them form the one place.

I add set-up basic view and components and also provide the redux-store to main file from where all the App will be driven.
