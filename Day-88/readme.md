When we want to developed REST-APIs using NodeJS, first thing or library comes to our mind is ExpressJS, but thats not the only option to do so, a couple years ago, one library named "fastify" get introduced which is almost powerful and easy as ExpressJS.

-> That doesn't mean ExpressJS is not that good or any problem in that, but alternate option for everything is acceptable and fasify is also just an alternate option for ExpressJS.

-> Both the library has their own pros and conse and we use one of them accordingly.

Today, I explore "fastify" library and how its different from ExpressJS, and I also learn how we can develope REST-APIs using "fastify".
