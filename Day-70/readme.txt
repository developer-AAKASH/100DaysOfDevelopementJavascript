This App.js file contains the code which I have written, all the other thing is same as defaukt folder structure, if you want to test my code, just copy paste my App.js with your App.js.

So today I used, native-base, react-native-vector-icons, and react-native-snackbar packages in order to complete my projects.

I also learn about writing seprate component and how to use them sepratly.
