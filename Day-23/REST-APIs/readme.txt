5 types of requests mostly used while working with REST APIs....
1) GET :: To fetch the data.
2) POST :: To add the new data.
3) PUT :: To update the data but this will update the whole object.
4) PATCH :: This will also update the details but this can update any piece of data
  rather than updating whole object.
5) DELETE :: To delete the data.
