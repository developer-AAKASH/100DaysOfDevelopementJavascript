Today, I complete my multi-docker-containerization project in which I configure one sample node project which is dependent on mongodb database which I configured in seprate "mongo" docker image.

This is how multi-docker image configured under one main/major docker container.

-> I get to know about "docker-compose" which is the reason/tool for performing multiple docker images.

-> I also learned about "yaml" files and how to donfigure them.
