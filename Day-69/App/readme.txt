This App.js file contains the code which I have written, all the other thing is same as defaukt folder structure, if you want to test my code, just copy paste my App.js with your App.js.

So today, I learn how to take permission for accessing camera and for making this process smooth I used React-native-camera which makes life easy while dealing with Camera.

If you are using this code, in order to run it succecfuly, you supposed to grant permission in android folder structure and iOS too.

And for detailed info you can visit this packge's npm website for all more details.
