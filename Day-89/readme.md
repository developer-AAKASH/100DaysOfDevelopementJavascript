--> The phrase "it works on my machine" is horrible when your developed software or application can works properly in production, and the thing which can save you is Docker !!

--> Docker is not the only option for such a situation, but the one of the most used and very powerful option to choose !!

--> Today I start with docker and I get to know about docker.

-> I understand what is a container in docker.


--> Now there is confusion also that is virtualisation and docker is the same thing or not ?!

->Well, the answer is when you see from the top, it looks the same but internally,  there is little miner difference in these two things.
