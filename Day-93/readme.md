Today, I complete my containerization of the project on which I am working.

I learn How you can select a base image according to your project language and framework in order to reduce the manual steps. I also set the default working directory in order to make the folder structure of the project better and convincing.

I also learn how we set the proper command to make our project run in any type of environment. Such a command is like an air-tight seal to make sure that our app will run successfully.

I also add some commands which will increase the performance and don't repeat certain steps and use the caching for fast performance.

I also start with a multi-docker image project, in which we can combine two different docker image into one image to make a multi-functionality project with docker.
