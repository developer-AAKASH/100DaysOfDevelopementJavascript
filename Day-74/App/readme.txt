This App.js file contains the code which I have written, all the other thing is same as defaukt folder structure, if you want to test my code, just copy paste my App.js with your App.js.

So in today's folder structure, I move the App.js file in to "src" folder and also make change in my index.js to let my app know about this change.

Today Its all about redux and today I define actions and reducers for redux setup.
