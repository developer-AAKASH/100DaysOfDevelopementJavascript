Deployment:
	It is basically process of uploading your app or apk to google play store or App store.
	-> This process require some additional steps to make it poosible for running our app globaly.
	
	-> Just apk is not sufficient, you should also provide a your signature file which uniquly identify your identity on the globe.
	-> This signature will be digital only and this file geneated from key store file. this key-store file is nothing but a hash/encrypted file which holds our all the confidential crendential. 
	
	APK + Signature file + app.bundle
	
	we upload aab which generates extra sdk for different android versions.
	
	1). Generating the key-store file :
	Android studio : -> go to any project -> go to its build options, -> then go generate signed Bundle/apk... -> select App-bundle, -> and select create new -> ( then set path and give name to it ) -> then fill the key value pair in that pop-up.
	
	2). Do some changes to gradles :

	-> alias is basically you are giving name to your app or updated code.
	-> copy that key-store file to your-project/android/app/.
		and paste here.
	-> Then go to android/gradle.properties 
	
	 and paste this thing... 
		MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=your-key-store-filename.keystore
		MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
		MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
		MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
	
	Note: After following this process, if due to file/apk size, your upload get failed, 
	you can un-comment line starting with, "# org.gradle.jvmargs=-X.....", in this line, 2048 m means 2048 MB so here, you can increase the size and that error will be solved."
	
	-> Now pase this line to your android/app/build.gradle -> in android section.
	[ // this brackets is just for differentiate the lines... dont include it...
		signingConfigs {
		release {
		    if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
		        storeFile file(MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
		        storePassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
		        keyAlias MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
		        keyPassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
		    }
		}
		}
        ]
        
        -> And in same file, if you scroll down, in buildTypes section -> 	release {} 
        	paste this line.
        [
        	signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        ]
        
        -> Now all the steps is done, ite time to build the apk.
	
	3). Generate apk/bundle:
		fire below commands in your projec folder.
		[
			cd android
			./gradlew bundleRelease -- for generating bundle
			./gradlew assembleRelease -- for generating apk
		]
	
	-> Now go to android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release -> here you find app-release.aab
	
	-> and if you have fires assembleRelease option, you find android/app/build/outputs/apk/release -- apk file will be here.
