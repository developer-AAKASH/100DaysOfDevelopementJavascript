Today, I learn about deployment steps for deploying android apps.

Also I get to know about React-Expo which is nothing but, Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
