--> Testing is an essential and key face of any software development cycle because in this face only, you can check whether your code is running as expected or not and according to that, you can modify your code.

-> But while developing a giantic softwares, testing by hand becomes too tidious task, and thats where your testing automation and testing frameworks 
comes in the picture.

--> Today, I learn about "unit-testing" and BDD ( Behavior-driven developmen ) which is a well-known 
testing model to test your software with all corner cases.

-> I also learn about "chai" library which is very famous and well known library for testing-automation in javascript.
