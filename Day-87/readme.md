Today I integrate Maps in my food-delivery-app. I used google maps API for my App.

-> I also learn about using different font-files to make app more attractive.

-> My App is running on static data, functionality is working on static data, as it is bit heavy app and I more focused on UI-design, I used static data for my convince.
